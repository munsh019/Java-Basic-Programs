# Java Basic Programs

This repository contains a collection of simple Java programs that I created while practicing basic programming concepts. Each file focuses on one small task such as loops, conditions, arrays, or string handling.

## Programs Included

- **Alternate.java**  
  Combines two arrays by taking elements alternately from each one.

- **FactorialCalculator.java**  
  Calculates the factorial of a number.

- **Fibo.java**  
  Prints Fibonacci numbers.

- **IsPrime.java**  
  Checks whether a number is prime or not.

- **Lens.java**  
  Counts or checks the length of a string (simple string handling program).

- **Min.java**  
  Finds the minimum value from a set of numbers.

- **MulWord.java**  
  Small string or word-related program (e.g., repeating or processing a word).

- **PalindromeCheck.java**  
  Checks if a string or number is a palindrome.

- **Remove.java**  
  Removes characters or parts of a string (basic string manipulation).

- **Reverse.java**  
  Reverses a string or number.

## How to Run

You can compile and run any program using:

```sh
javac FileName.java
java FileName
